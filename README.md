# Automated Trading System

This is the new version of the automated trading system using E-Trade's API. This version is written in Python for now, may add support
Java later. This program uses E-Trade's API to get access to an account to perform automated trades. Selenium is used to automate the login
process required for the API. Using a password manager such as LastPass or your browser's password manager login is automated.

Screenshots added later will show how this works.
Code and description coming soon.
